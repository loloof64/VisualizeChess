      For each new game, you choose the minimum number of moves from start (computer generates a position by playing random moves from the start), and the count of moves to visualize.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then you are given a screen with the generated exercise.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that you'll be able to enter your solution in an interactive chess board.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally there is a summary page of the correction, your solution and the exercise that was asked to you.
